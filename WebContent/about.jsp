<p><font size="5"><b>About SportsBreaker</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p>SportsBreaker is a place where 
sports fans around the world can find, share and discuss anything related 
to sports on the web. All content is found by and voted on by our users, 
which gives you the power to decide what you think is newsworthy; we 
don't really have a say in the matter.<br></p>
<p>So, what's the point? Well, 
we don't feel that you should be told who or what is interesting. 
We think you should tell each other. Everything on SportsBreaker is 
submitted by you, the user. From there, other fans just like you will 
vote on whether they like it or not - nothing complicated, just a 
simple thumbs up or thumbs down. If your story gains enough interest, 
it graduates from "Local News" to "National News" and finds 
itself on our front page for the world to see. Of course, that's just 
the first order of business. The second is the real reason the site 
was created.<br></p>
<p>The one thing we don't want 
to do is tell you what teams you should be reading about. That's up 
to you, not us. Most of our favorite teams don't regularly make national 
headlines every day, but that doesn't mean people aren't writing 
about them. That's why we've organized SportsBreaker in a way that 
forces the biggest franchises and the smallest hometown teams to finally 
become equals. Customizing your own set of Team Tabs allows each user 
to view whatever team news they want. For example, we have a pretty 
good feeling that Red Sox fans probably won't be surfing the Yankees 
tab, but chances are they're pretty interested in the Celtics, Patriots, 
and Boston College. To read more about customizing your Team Tabs, <a href="<c:url value="how.jsp"/>">

<p>We also realize that being 
a sports fan doesn't just involve soaking up information, but also 
spitting it back out, usually at your rivals. That's why a lot of 
our users spend most their time interacting with others in each story's
comments section. We've given you the soapbox to make your thoughts 
known, because as sports fans ourselves, we realize that your opinion 
is really the only one that matters.<br></p>
<p>In the end, we're tired of 
being told that the Cowboys, Irish, and Yankees are the only teams that 
are newsworthy. We believe that all stories are created equal, so we've 
leveled the national playing field, whether those in Dallas, South Bend 
or New York like it or not. <br></p>

<p><font size="5"><b>How SportsBreaker Works</b></font> <br></p>
<p class="big"><b>Find and Share</b></p>
<p>When you come across something 
sports-related (story, blog, video, etc.) that you think is interesting, 
let others know about it by submitting it to SportsBreaker. You will 
be asked to give it a headline, write a short description, and assign 
it to a team, group of teams, player, division, conference, or entire 
league. The story is then immediately posted along with other upcoming 
stories on the associated team or player's Wire, as well as the <a href="<c:url value="index.jsp"/>">
National Wire</a>.<br></p>
<p class="big"><b>Vote</b></p>
<p>Each submission has its own 
score associated with it. If you find the particular story interesting 
or newsworthy, vote by clicking either the thumbs-up or thumbs-down 
icon next to the headline.<br></p>
<p>Every story on SportsBreaker 
follows the nature of a real-world news story. If it gains enough interest 
and earns a high-enough Current Activity Rating (CAR), it is no longer 
purely a local story, but reaches the national stage. When this happens, 
it is moved to the <a href="<c:url value="index.jsp"/>">National News</a> section found on the front page 
of Sportsbreaker.com. From there, the sky is the limit. <br>
</p>
<p class="big"><b>Discuss</b></p>
<p>Half the fun of sports is the 
debate that surrounds each story. Whether its friendly commentary or 
heated arguments among rivals, you're going to find a lot being said 
behind each story in its own comments section.<br></p>
<p class="big"><b>Customize</b></p>
<p>We realize that most fans have 
more than just one team that they're passionate about. That's why 
we have organized Bench'd so that every team you follow is just one 
click away. Once you have registered, you can create what we call Team 
Tabs. For example, if you graduated from Texas A&amp;M and lived in 
Dallas, you would most likely want tabs for the Aggies, Mavericks, Cowboys, 
and the Rangers. Maybe even throw in a University of Texas tab to keep 
an eye on the enemy. Add in Tiger Woods, Jimmie Johnson and Andy Roddick 
and you've got access to eight team and player pages all just one 
click away. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="5"><b>Statistics</b></font><br></p>
<p>We love stats. All sports fans 
do. Therefore, each story has a set of stats associated with it, which 
is available on each story's landing page. That way, you can see exactly 
how it has performed in relation to others. The following is a short 
description of each stat we keep.<br></p>

<p class="big blue"><b>Score</b></p>
<p>The score in green is the number of thumbs up.  The score in red is the number of thumbs down.</p>

<p class="big blue"><b>Votes</b></p>
<p>The total number of votes - thumbs up + thumbs down.</p>

<p class="big blue"><b>Visits</b></p>
<p>The number of times someone has visited this story by clicking on a link from sportsbreker.com.</p>

<p class="big blue"><b>CAR (Current Activity Rating)</b></p>
<p>This is a super-secret algorithm used to determine how popular a story is at a given point in time.</p>

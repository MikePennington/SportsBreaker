<p><font size="4" face="Arial">Privacy Policy</font><br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">SportsBreaker realizes that you care 
about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take 
your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more 
about our privacy policy. By visiting the SportsBreaker website, you 
are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This Privacy Policy covers SportsBreaker&#39;s 
treatment of personal information that SportsBreaker gathers when you 
are on the SportsBreaker website and when you use SportsBreaker services. 
This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that SportsBreaker 
does not own or control, or to individuals that SportsBreaker does not 
employ or manage.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Information Collected by SportsBreaker</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We only collect personal information 
that is relevant to the purpose of our website, which is to enable users 
to discover and share sports information with one another. This information 
allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. 
We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with 
this objective. We collect the following types of information from our 
SportsBreaker users:</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Information You Provide to Us: ?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We receive and store any information 
you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can 
choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may 
not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.</font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Registration: In order for 
  you to use SportsBreaker services, such as submitting new links to the 
  website, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration 
  form, we require select personal information (including your full name, 
  city, state and e-mail address).</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">User Profile: To allow you 
  to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration, 
  we enable you to provide additional information, such as favorite teams, 
  hometown, college attended, and high school attended. In addition, you 
  may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. As indicated 
  below, in the section titled &quot;Sharing Your Information&quot;, you 
  can control how your information is displayed and used.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Automatic Information: </font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">We receive and store certain 
  types of information whenever you interact with us. SportsBreaker and 
  its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain &quot;traffic 
  data&quot; on their server logs from your browser including your IP 
  address, SportsBreaker cookie information, and the page you requested. 
  SportsBreaker uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with 
  its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">SportsBreaker may collect 
  and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. 
  This includes User Profile pages.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Many companies offer programs 
  that help you to visit websites anonymously. While SportsBreaker will 
  not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot 
  recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br> <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">E-mail Communications</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">SportsBreaker is very concerned about 
your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third 
party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the &quot;Sharing 
Your Information&quot; section below. SportsBreaker may send out e-mails 
with SportsBreaker-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. 
You may also receive notification e-mails from SportsBreaker, which 
inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed 
on the site. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please visit 
the Preferences section of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions 
contained in the unwanted e-mail message. However, please note that 
in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those 
regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates 
to our policies) from us.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Cookies</font> <br></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers 
  that we transfer to your computer&#39;s hard drive through your Web browser 
  to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and 
  when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. SportsBreaker 
  cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information 
  collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us 
  who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The &quot;help&quot; portion 
  of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to 
  prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the 
  browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable 
  cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies 
  allow you to use some of SportsBreaker&#39;s best features.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of our business partners, 
  like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access 
  to, or control over, these cookies.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br> <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Sharing Your Information</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Because SportsBreaker enables people 
to discover and share sports information with one another, information 
about the people who use SportsBreaker is an integral part of the SportsBreaker 
experience. Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal 
information to anyone and that we will share your personal information 
only as described below.</font> <br></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">SportsBreaker Personnel: SportsBreaker 
  personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access 
  to user information if necessary in the normal course of SportsBreaker 
  business.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Business Transfers: In some 
  cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, 
  user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. 
  Moreover, if SportsBreaker, or substantially all of its assets, were 
  acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Protection of SportsBreaker 
  and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good 
  faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or 
  apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, 
  property, or safety of SportsBreaker, our employees, our users, or others. 
  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations 
  for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">User Profile information: 
  Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such 
  as your full name and location, may be displayed to other SportsBreaker 
  users in your User Profile. The User Profile is the area on SportsBreaker 
  where we allow you to tell other SportsBreaker users about yourself 
  and your interests. You may control what personal information is displayed 
  in your User Profile by visiting the Preferences section of your User 
  Profile.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Member Directory: The e-mail 
  address that you submit upon registration will be searchable by other 
  SportsBreaker users who know you by your email address, unless you choose 
  to opt out of this feature. This is primarily so that other users can 
  find you to establish friendship through SportsBreaker. You may opt-out 
  of this feature by visiting the Preferences section of your User Profile.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Social sharing of data: SportsBreaker 
  allows other users to browse stories that you have submitted or commented 
  on. This information is made available via your User Profile or within 
  the permalink URL of the story on which you performed the action. SportsBreaker 
  may choose to post this data on other site features.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Friends&#39; Activity: Much like 
  other online social networks, SportsBreaker allows non-friends to browse 
  your friends&#39; activity (</font><a href="http://sportsbreaker.com/users/stewade/friends" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>http://sportsbreaker.com/users<WBR>/stewade/friends</u></font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">).</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">API: SportsBreaker will allow 
  third parties access to all SportsBreaker data that is already publicly 
  available through the SportsBreaker website. SportsBreaker will keep 
  private any passwords.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Syndication: SportsBreaker 
  allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the 
  SportsBreaker website.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">With Your Consent: Except 
  as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is 
  shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the 
  purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able 
  to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br> <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Keeping Information Secure</font> <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Your SportsBreaker account 
  information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. 
  Protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer 
  by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Only employees who need personal 
  information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service 
  representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept 
  up to date on our privacy and security practices.</font></li>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Ways to Control Display and Use of Your 
Information</font> <br></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">As stated previously, you 
  can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may be unable 
  to use certain features on our website, such as posting new links.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">By visiting your User Profile, 
  you can correct, amend, add or delete personal information on our website. 
  When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the 
  unrevised information in our records.</font></li>

  your SportsBreaker account by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:support@sportsbreaker.com" target="_blank">support@sportsbreaker.com</a>.</font></li>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Children Under 18 Years of Age</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You must be 13 years and older to register 
to use the SportsBreaker website. As a result, SportsBreaker does not 
specifically collect information about children. If we learn that SportsBreaker 
has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will 
delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors 
between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents&#39; permission 
before using SportsBreaker or sending information about themselves or 
anyone else over the Internet.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Changes to this Privacy Policy</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">SportsBreaker may amend this Privacy 
Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion. Use of information 
we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time 
such information is used. If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, 
we will notify you by posting an announcement on the SportsBreaker website 
so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, 
and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</font> <br>

to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on 
damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of California state 
law.</font> <br> <br></p>

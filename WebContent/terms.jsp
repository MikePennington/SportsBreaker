<p><font size="2" face="Arial">No agency, partnership, joint venture, 
or employment is created as a result of the Terms of Use and you do 
not have any authority of any kind to bind SportsBreaker in any respect 
whatsoever. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any 
right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further 
rights hereunder. SportsBreaker shall not be liable for any failure 
to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from 
any cause beyond SportsBreaker&#39;s reasonable control, including, without 
limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation 
(including &quot;line-noise&quot; interference). If any provision of 
the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision 
shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that 
the Terms of Use shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and 
enforceable. The Terms of Use is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable 
by you except with SportsBreaker&#39;s prior written consent. SportsBreaker 
may transfer, assign or delegate the Terms of Use and its rights and

construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, as 
if made within California between two residents thereof, and the parties 
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court of San Francisco 
County and the United States District Court for the Northern District 
of California. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (but without 
limiting SportsBreaker&#39;s right to seek injunctive or other equitable 
relief in any court of competent jurisdiction), any disputes arising 
with respect to this Agreement shall be referred to an arbitrator affiliated 
with JAMS, The Resolution Experts. The arbitrator shall be selected 
by joint agreement of the parties. In the event the parties cannot agree 
on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating party providing 
the other party with written notice that it plans to seek arbitration, 
the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS, which 
arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to resolve 
the dispute. The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and 
binding on the parties. The arbitration proceeding shall be carried 
on and heard in San Francisco, California using the English language 
and pursuant to the rules of JAMS. In any action or proceeding to enforce 
rights under the Terms of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled 
to recover costs and attorneys&#39; fees. Both parties agree that the Terms 
of Use is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding 
of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral 
agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the 
subject matter of the Terms of Use, and that all modifications must 
be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided 
herein.</font> <br></p>
